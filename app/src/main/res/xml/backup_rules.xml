      Sentinel 🛡️: Security Hardening
      This file is intentionally configured to exclude all content from backups as a
      defense-in-depth measure. The primary control `android:allowBackup="false"` is set in the
      AndroidManifest.xml. This configuration ensures that even if backups are accidentally
      re-enabled, no sensitive user data (databases, preferences, etc.) will be exposed.
