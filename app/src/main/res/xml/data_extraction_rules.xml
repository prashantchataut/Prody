      Sentinel 🛡️: Security Hardening
      This file is intentionally configured to exclude all content from device-to-device
      transfers. The primary control `android:allowBackup="false"` in AndroidManifest.xml also
      governs this, but this rule provides an explicit defense-in-depth layer. It prevents
      sensitive user data from being moved off the device via this mechanism.
