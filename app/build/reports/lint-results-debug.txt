Version of Lint API this lint check is using is 14.
The Lint API version currently running is 16 (8.7+). [ObsoleteLintCustomCheck]

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteLintCustomCheck":
   Lint can be extended with "custom checks": additional checks implemented by
   developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages
   required by a library or a company coding style guideline.

   The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a
   performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.

   This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete
   APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.

   It may also flag issues found to be using a newer version of the API,
   meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or
   Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.

[MissingPermission]
            alarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(
            ^

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingPermission":
   This check scans through your code and libraries and looks at the APIs
   being used, and checks this against the set of permissions required to
   access those APIs. If the code using those APIs is called at runtime, then
   the program will crash.

   Furthermore, for permissions that are revocable (with targetSdkVersion 23),
   client code must also be prepared to handle the calls throwing an exception
   if the user rejects the request for permission at runtime.

C:\projects\Prody\Prody\app\build.gradle.kts:17: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 35
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than
   your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with, various
   compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues
   to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the targetSdkVersion
   is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:
   https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html
   as well as follow this guide:

    <application
    ^

   Explanation for issues of type "RemoveWorkManagerInitializer":
   If an android.app.Application implements
   androidx.work.Configuration.Provider,
   the default androidx.startup.InitializationProvider needs to be removed
   from the
   AndroidManifest.xml file.

C:\projects\Prody\Prody\app\src\main\res\drawable\ic_splash_logo.xml:3: Warning: Limit vector icons sizes to 200×200 to keep icon drawing fast; see https://developer.android.com/studio/write/vector-asset-studio#when for more [VectorRaster]
    android:width="240dp"
                   ~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "VectorRaster":
   Vector icons require API 21 or API 24 depending on used features, but when
   minSdkVersion is less than 21 or 24 and Android Gradle plugin 1.4 or higher
   is used, a vector drawable placed in the drawable folder is automatically
   moved to drawable-anydpi-v21 or drawable-anydpi-v24 and bitmap images are
   generated for different screen resolutions for backwards compatibility.

   However, there are some limitations to this raster image generation, and
   this lint check flags elements and attributes that are not fully supported.
   You should manually check whether the generated output is acceptable for
   those older devices.

   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.

C:\projects\Prody\Prody\app\src\main\res\values\strings.xml:48: Warning: Replace "..." with ellipsis character (…, &#8230;) ? [TypographyEllipsis]
    <string name="journal_placeholder">Pour your heart out. Buddha is listening...</string>
                                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "TypographyEllipsis":
   You can replace the string "..." with a dedicated ellipsis character,
   ellipsis character (u2026, &#8230;). This can help make the text more
   readable.

C:\projects\Prody\Prody\app\build.gradle.kts:149: Warning: Use version catalog instead [UseTomlInstead]
    coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.1.3")
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "UseTomlInstead":
   If your project is using a libs.versions.toml file, you should place all
   Gradle dependencies in the TOML file. This lint check looks for version
   declarations outside of the TOML file and suggests moving them (and in the
   IDE, provides a quickfix to performing the operation automatically).
