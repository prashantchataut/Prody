## 2025-05-15 - Harden Network Security and Journal Privacy
**Vulnerability:** Placeholder certificate pins in `network_security_config.xml` and missing `FLAG_SECURE` on sensitive journal screens.
**Learning:** Sequential placeholders like `GThRnpaJ1x8I2c4e8p5h6k7l8m9n0o1p2q3r4s5t6u8=` were used for certificate pinning, which provides no real security against MITM attacks. Additionally, highly private user journal content was exposed to screenshots and screen recordings.
**Prevention:** Always use real SHA-256 pins from production certificates and include intermediates/backup pins for resilience. Use `FLAG_SECURE` on all screens displaying or capturing sensitive user data.

## 2026-01-31 - Standardize Secure Database Encryption and Optimize Passphrase Access
**Vulnerability:** Redundant and insecure database provisioning in `AppModule.kt` bypassed SQLCipher encryption, while `SecureDatabaseManager` used asynchronous storage that forced thread-blocking `runBlocking` calls during Room initialization.
**Learning:** Prody had two different database initialization paths, and the primary Hilt-managed one was providing unencrypted access to sensitive user data. Furthermore, using `EncryptedFile` for passphrase storage required `suspend` functions that were being accessed via `runBlocking` on the main thread, risking app stability.
**Prevention:** Centralize database provisioning in a single source of truth (`ProdyDatabase.getInstance`) that enforces encryption and seeding for all callers (app and widgets). Use `EncryptedSharedPreferences` for database passphrases to enable secure, synchronous access and eliminate `runBlocking`.

## 2026-01-31 - Credential and Privacy Hardening
**Vulnerability:** Leaking API keys in Logcat via OkHttp interceptors and debug logs, and missing UI protection for therapeutic chats.
**Learning:** Prody's `OpenRouterService` used `HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY` in debug mode without redacting the `Authorization` header, exposing API keys to anybody with ADB access. Additionally, Haven't therapeutic screens lacked `FLAG_SECURE`, risking user privacy.
**Prevention:** Always use `redactHeader("Authorization")` in network interceptors. Remove logs that print partial secrets. Enforce `FLAG_SECURE` on all therapeutic and reflection screens by default.
