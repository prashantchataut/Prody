## 2025-05-15 - Harden Network Security and Journal Privacy
**Vulnerability:** Placeholder certificate pins in `network_security_config.xml` and missing `FLAG_SECURE` on sensitive journal screens.
**Learning:** Sequential placeholders like `GThRnpaJ1x8I2c4e8p5h6k7l8m9n0o1p2q3r4s5t6u8=` were used for certificate pinning, which provides no real security against MITM attacks. Additionally, highly private user journal content was exposed to screenshots and screen recordings.
**Prevention:** Always use real SHA-256 pins from production certificates and include intermediates/backup pins for resilience. Use `FLAG_SECURE` on all screens displaying or capturing sensitive user data.
