## 2025-01-26 - Unified Haptic Feedback for Buttons
**Learning:** High-quality mobile apps benefit significantly from consistent tactile feedback on primary interactions. Prody has a custom `rememberProdyHaptic()` utility that respects user settings and should be used in all design system interactive components.
**Action:** Always integrate `rememberProdyHaptic()` and `haptic.click()` or `haptic.selection()` into base interactive components (Buttons, Chips, ClickableCards) to ensure a "premium" feel across the entire app without duplicating logic.

## 2025-01-26 - Dynamic Form Validation Feedback
**Learning:** Providing real-time, visual feedback as users approach form constraints (like character limits) significantly reduces friction and errors. Semantic color shifts (warning at 80%, error at 100%) are more intuitive than simple counters.
**Action:** Implement dynamic character counters in all high-priority input forms. Use `ProdyDesignTokens.SemanticColors.warning` for the cautionary state to provide a consistent cross-app language for constraints.

## 2025-01-26 - Semantic Validation Feedback for Accessibility
**Learning:** For users with visual or cognitive impairments, simple text counters are often insufficient. Combining semantic color shifts with bold weight and proper ARIA-equivalent `contentDescription` on associated action icons creates a multi-modal feedback loop that is significantly more accessible.
**Action:** When implementing input validation, ensure feedback is multi-modal: use color (`SemanticColors`), typography (`FontWeight.Bold`), and accessibility strings (`stringResource`) simultaneously to communicate state.
