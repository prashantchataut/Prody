## 2025-01-26 - Unified Haptic Feedback for Buttons
**Learning:** High-quality mobile apps benefit significantly from consistent tactile feedback on primary interactions. Prody has a custom `rememberProdyHaptic()` utility that respects user settings and should be used in all design system interactive components.
**Action:** Always integrate `rememberProdyHaptic()` and `haptic.click()` or `haptic.selection()` into base interactive components (Buttons, Chips, ClickableCards) to ensure a "premium" feel across the entire app without duplicating logic.
